# Project Feedback

## General remarks

I would describe this as a competently executed, if uncomplicated user interface.  You set out to acheive a goal, and that was attained.  In order to secure a higher grade, you would have needed far more by way of complex user interactions on the site.  I note the nice page for the author's works, but this is minimal.  That said, the site was nicely designed, and the code was reasonably good (see below for more on this).

## accessibility

This wasn't bad at all, though some contrast issues exist.  The main drawback is the fact that the carousel is not keyboard-accessible.  Given your goal was to achieve accessibility for colour-blind individuals, a simple style-switcher would have been good, and not difficult to implement.

## Code quality

This was okay.  Structure was generally good, and the CSS was nicely designed.  My major concern with this project team is the lack of involvement from several team members in the code development.  The git commit-history reveals no input at all from various participants in this project.  Whilst this is a team effort, it has been made clear that there will be individual marks for all participants.

## Evaluation

### Report

This was good, in fact I would comment that this was the best part of your year's work.  I liked the questions, structure and the way it was analysed.  I will comment (no marks deducted for this) that the reference you cited stating that 50 participants are required for an evaluation is, in many cases, nonsense.  It depends on the data you're trying to capture, the participants you get and many other factors.  So don't worry about the fact that you only had 5.  I have run many successful evaluations with this number.  If interested, and for your 3rd/fourth year projects, check out Steve Krugg's book Rocket Surgery Made easy, or articles by Helen Petri (University of York) on how to conduct evaluations with small numbers of participants.

## Supporting materials

All present, and seemed to coroborate the findings in the report.  I presume you have paper copies of these, so if so please put in an envelope, mark as "project 26 paperwork" and leave with the School Secretary.
